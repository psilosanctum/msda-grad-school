# Final Presentation Outline
##  Introduction Slide - Importance of Energy Consumption/Production (Collin 2-3 mins)
    **Objective: Answer a problem facing organizations, policymakers, and consumers**
    (1) Economic indicator
        - Energy is the ultimate form of currency 
        - Manufacturing goods requires mechanical/electrical energy for machines and providing services requires chemical energy (food) for humans
        - Transporting food to grocery stores requires energy from fuel
        - Refrigeration is required to keep essential food products from spoiling
        - Money was created to simplify the exchange of value for goods and services
            - It is attempting to quantify the value of energy exerted to provide these goods and services
            - Ex: I pay $10 for a hamburger, fries, and a drink. This meal supplies the human body with 2000 calories of energy.
            - Ex: I pay ~$250 a month to CPS for consuming 5000 kWh of electrical energy to cool my house with air conditioning, cook food, use electronics, etc.
    (2) Scarce resources
        - Most energy consumed comes from fossil fuels which are scarce
        - As scarce resources are depleted, there has to be a collective effort among the global community to pivot towards renewable energy. 
            - Once our scarce resources are nearly depleted, countries who refused to invest in renewable infrastructure will most likely go to war to obtain remaining resources.
            - Those countries will also experience a decline in their standard of living because they do not have enough supply to generate the energy necessary to meet demand.
    (3) Climate change policies
        - Climate activists/government officials claim that fossil fuels are causing climate change, so which countries are contributing the most to climate change.
        - Climate change policies affect the cost of energy:
            - Since burning fossil fuels generates most of our current energy, fossil fuel regulations lead to increases in energy costs
            - If the cost of energy rises, the cost of goods and services rise - highly correlated.
            - Increased costs reduce the standard of living for citizens (i.e consumers); therefore, energy sector policymakers must balance the needs of climate change activists who want to eliminate fossil fuels with the energy demand required to sustain the country's economy.
        - What if climate change activists are wrong? The Earth is a complex system.
        - What if there are ulterior motives behind the climate change propaganda?
        - If climate change activists are wrong/pushing false narratives, unnecessary fossil fuel regulations will negatively impact global citizens by reducing their standard of living.   

# 1st Charts - Time Series Graph - Global Electricity Consumption Increase Over Time (Joaquin 2-3 mins)
    - Global electricity consumption has increased by 3.5x since 1980
    - Causes: population increases, technological advances, developing countries being industrialized
    - As electricity consumption increases, pivoting towards sustainable, renewable energy is essential as scarce resources dry up.
    - Add additional time series of the top 15 electricity consumers

# 2nd Charts - World Heatmap Visualizing Electricity Consumption by Country for 2021 (2-3 mins)
    - Include pie chart to show percentage of electricity consumption as a whole for 2021
    - Maybe a video of the map changing over time
    - Emphasize China's electricity consumption vs. the rest of the top 15 countries
        - China leads the world in electricity consumption
        - China consumes 2x more electricity than the US (US is #2 in worldwide electricity consumption)
        - Explanation: China has one of the biggest populations and leads the world in production of goods (manufacturing plants consume huge amounts of electricity)
        - Climate change activism mostly insignificant if China is not on board
        - Climate change propaganda in the US - justfied, overreaction, or hidden agenda?

# 3rd Charts - Distributions Losses (2-3 mins)
    - Identify chart that best illustrates distribution losses as a percent of consumption
    - Compare distribution losses across countries
    - Reducing distribution losses is important because that electricity is essentially wasted, not used productuively. 
    - *** Still need to identify the best story to tell for distribution losses ***

# 4th Charts - Electricity Imports/Exports/Net Imports (2-3 mins)
    - Still determining if there's a valuable story here
    - Maybe: Countries with negative net imports == exporting excess electricity to other countries
        - My assumption is that exporting electricity is preferred over importing
            - Exporting means a country is consuming less electricity than it's producing; therefore, it does not have to rely on external providers to satisfy its energy demands
            - Exporting electricity generates revenue for the exporter while assisting the importer's energy demands
            - Importing energy is unsustainable over the long-term
                - Geopolitics and monetary policy make the cost of importing electricity volatile
