libname mylib "p:\";                               libname is how you point to a directory where permanent sas files are found      
filename bigrec "p:\fa15_data.txt"  lrecl = 65576;     filename is how you point sas at a raw data file
data mytemp;                                       here is how you create a temporary sas data set for analysis
infile bigrec;                                     file tells sas that here comes a description of a record called bigrec
input                                              input tells sas that coming next are the variables that you want to read in and their col #s
