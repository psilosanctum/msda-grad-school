&gt;*Five Ways To Make Your Resume Sink Faster Than The Titanic*
&gt;
&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement â€“ I swap â€œProficient in Word, Excel and PowerPointâ€ for â€œProficient in Breathing Oxygenâ€ and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes Iâ€™ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to â€œsinkâ€ your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with â€œFluency in English,â€ I assume you are â€œfluentâ€ in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So donâ€™t re-assure me.

&gt;While most employers definitely want to know you as a person and the things you enjoy in your off time, pull off all of those ""special skills"" that everyone has and just aren't important for your job. Things like ""Microsoft Office (all ver.)"" or ""Windows and Mac Operating Systems"" are not only implied for any job that requires use of a computer, they take up space you could use to make a real impactâ€”or better yet, keep your resume trim and to the point.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow.

They shot the spacecraft toward Sol, hoping one of the inner planets would prove hospitable enough.

A petition is a representation of the petitioner's desires to enact change and, when the petitioners actually commit to the topic changes do occur.

Go for it, get your 100k signatures and maybe she will actually get the dye job done; politicians wear those stupid lapel pins because of ""popular opinion"" maybe your movement will have a similar effect.

Your arguments hold no weight whatsoever. Honestly, I hope you're trolling because I didn't think people who claim everything is racist like you do actually existed.

He first said the phrase ""the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings"" on a 1978 newscast discussing the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets. The phrase was then attributed to Bullets coach Dick Motta, who had borrowed it during Washington's successful 1978 title run.[7]

- Road Closures (Not all of them, but more than GMaps, as GMaps gets its closure info from Waze)

  - Additions like Parking Lot Roads or New neighborhoods can be live in the app in as little as 18 hours. 
- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps
- Hazard &amp; Police Reports  
  
As a delivery driver, I am ALL OVER the city (Though, admittedly, south of 90 doesnt order much from amazon). And I've use Waze and Google maps, even tried apple maps (for about 5 minutes) and various other paid navigation apps... The only reasonable options are Google Maps and Waze, but I still prefer Waze over Google Maps.  
  
Also, Waze only gets better the more people use it. Even more accurate traffic data (Though its very good as it is), and faster updates for road closures and reopenings, accidents, etc.  
  
Also, I LOVE when people give me delivery notes ""My address isnt in GPS so turn here, exit here, go X etc...."" I just put the address in Waze and 90% of the time at very least the road has been mapped, if not the individual house number too.

"The fuck you on about ? The reason the electric Bills being so high was due to Texas being capitalist shills. In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once. But the state public utility commission also contributed by setting the ERCOT price at $9,000 per megawatt-hour and keeping it there for a week, ensuring that bills for some Texans would skyrocket.

Hand outs ? Itâ€™s not a handout when youâ€™re being exploited by bullshit profit driven companies that looked at our situation and immediately realized how much profit they could make off people in desperate situations.

I may jumped the gun on what I was replying too but  if you think that ERCOTT isnâ€™t recouping from this in different ways, spreading the cost out over the next years, youâ€™re mistaken. 

My point still stands. So not only are people behind because of covid and loss of jobs, due to no fault of their own. Theyâ€™ll be paying increased electrical price overall.

Do you know if it worked out to lease the dark fiber that CPS has in the ground already?",Y,Y

From what I *can* see, it looks to me that testing has increased substantially by about 10,000 with about 50% more negative or inconclusive tests and 40% fewer positive tests between the peaks shown from the available dates in July to Nov 15.  
  
Wouldn't that suggest exactly what I was saying, that the increases we are seeing lately are largely due to increased testing, not increased infections?  
  
I understand that we're having increases over the relative dip we've had throughout the past couple of months, but it doesn't look to be on the same level as what we saw in July and August. So again, it seems like my question was on point.",N,N
I was choosing cyber security because itâ€™s growing and because I was an aircraft mechanic in the military and enjoyed fixing and maintaining equipment and doing data base management with equipment control before I left. Figured those skills could transfer well into cyber security. Was a computer science major but couldnâ€™t handle the STEM math classes which is why I switched to cyber security. Hopefully I made a good choice switching. ,N,Y

&gt; Total number of people convicted of trafficking minors
&gt; These charts show the total number of people convicted of trafficking minors in Texas that served prison time between 2012 and the present. The first chart shows numbers for the five counties with the most convictions overall. The second chart shows the same numbers for the five counties with the most convictions per capita.
&gt;   
&gt; *Per capita numbers were calculated using only counties with 100,000+ residents and at least four convictions.
&gt; Note: Totals may be underreported if cases of child trafficking were tried more generally as human trafficking

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams â€” while pimping Amber and Cooper â€” was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber â€” the name she used while she was being trafficked â€” asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",N,Y

"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I donâ€™t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me â€” besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide â€œEmergencyâ€ is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, Iâ€™m not strawman-ing if itâ€™s true, right?  Iâ€™m not basing my entire  argument on this point, Iâ€™m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And thatâ€™s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (Iâ€™m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didnâ€™t accuse me of this, but Iâ€™d still like to say that Iâ€™m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didnâ€™t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",Y,N

"&gt; People love to blame our politicians for not giving us the proper restrictions, but I and most reasonably responsible people I know, including basically my entire family, have self-quarantined, worn masks in public, and kept up with social distancing since before anyone was really ordering restrictions.

Congratulations. Now remember that 1/6 San Antonians (25yo or older) dropped out of high school. Only 1/3 ever finished college. We're [pretty close to the bottom](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2014/02/san-antonio-ranks-near-the-bottom-in-national.html) of educational attainment.

So you figure some dude with only a high school diploma is wondering what to do in a pandemic. He can google random shit and maybe he'll find a trustworthy site; maybe not. Did he ever learn how to do that?

The President isn't wearing a mask. Neither is the Vice President. What's he supposed to do? Copy the most powerful people in the country I suppose.

Like it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy. Or maybe they just listen to the President because ""he has all the info he needs.""

The absolute *most important* job the President has is to set the tone of the country. There's a reason this country went to fucking shit and everyone is miserable under Trump and it's because he set a terrible tone that has destroyed people's psyches.",Y,Y
