You officially rationalized intrusion. Even if it is as you say it is (it isn't), it doesn't make up for the principal of the fact. True, google's algorithms can figure out a lot. Wtf do you think the government is using?! Bringing up how bad other governments are doesn't make what the government is doing ""okay"". If anything, the government knows that keeping it's people comfortable allows them far more freedom to fuck over other countries than if they wanted to treat us like they were N.Korea.

People will fight for their fake ""freedom"" (usa) a lot harder than for an imposing government (n.korea) (staying within the confines of your examples).

I ran into this same situation with my first new-construction home.  I I had a room that was always warmer than all the others â€” called the A/C company to check it out (within the first year) and they showed up with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to get different readings to tell me it was within spec.  They also threw in other nonsensical reasons like getting more sun than other rooms (even though it shared a wall with two other bedrooms that didnâ€™t have cooling issues).  Basically they gave me a big list of reasons why they shouldnâ€™t have to do any actual work.  Note that at no point did they even look at the unit or duct work in the attic.

  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  

It would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking â€œit meets specsâ€ and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didnâ€™t stop to consider anything else.",N,N

I'm going to make the rash assumption that you are new(ish) to SA and don't realize what happens in SA parks on holidays.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLm8dukRJk4

There's no hiking, per se. It's more of a huge drunken party.  All the local parks, but mainly Breckenridge lately, become a mass of extended families pitching tents and CAMPING in the city park for the duration of the holiday, trashing the place and not picking up after themselves, which takes the city workers 2 days of cleanup.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other.  

That's the reason the parks are closed, because people can't behave and follow social distancing guidelines.   

The parks will be open again after the holiday weekend.

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams â€” while pimping Amber and Cooper â€” was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt;

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber â€” the name she used while she was being trafficked â€” asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",N,N

&amp;#x200B;

It is possible to find a studio apartment in SA for about $550/month.

Minimum wage works out to about $1,160/month.

Meaning that after rent a person has $610 to pay for everything else. Food, gas, car, insurance, healthcare, phone, electricity, water, everything.

And SA is a one of the cheaper places to live.

&amp;#x200B;

It ain't avocado toast and Starbucks that's making people poor, it's low wages.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and I know it's a side issue, but I never understood how avocado toast got to be the go to example of those awful young people wasting money. A loaf of bread at HEB is about ten cents a slice, an avocado typically costs about a dollar and you can get at least four pieces of avocado toast out of each one. 

So the total cost per piece of avocado toast is about 35 cents. Two for breakfast is 70 cents. \*\*THAT\*\* is the platonic example of how wasteful young people are spending their money on frivolities? Spending less than a dollar for breakfast is bad now Boomers?",N,N

They call in and report ""kidnapping"", ""assault"", and other crimes and when the dispatchers asks for the information, they cuss them out and say it's Bexar county who is the one who should be arrested. What's dumb about this is 2 things: 1) he goes to the constables office or to the smaller municipalities like Leon Valley and blames the sheriff's office and 2) they tie up the phone lines and have actual emergency calls waiting in queue while they continue to harass the dispatchers, hang up, and re-dial. Apparently his following is rather large enough that when he does these things they get hundreds of anonymous calls and death threats within hours following his arrest.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow.

Now imagine going somewhere, then coming back.  You'd need nearly 4 hours of free time to be able to do that.

The two things that can fix this more easily are reducing the number of stops the bus makes, and increasing the frequency.  You go to Germany or Spain and the bus doesn't stop every quarter mile.  It stops maybe once every mile or so.

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness.

You attended college.  You have typing skills and phone skills.  You want to avoid food (can't blame you, that's my wife's default and it sucks.)

Put together a solid CV.  And by that I mean research and learn how to sale yourself.  You are the product.  Send it to family and friends and former co-workers/bosses to get feedback.  It is very easy to short sell yourself.  

I saw on reddit that someone got a media job by doxing themselves as a karma whore and knowing how and when to use social media.  A few weeks ago I saw a post on linkedin that they were interviewing someone that listed google as a skill.

How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that sheâ€™s been able to do this quite well.

But itâ€™s extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you donâ€™t like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.

Municipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and Iâ€™m not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, thatâ€™s something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.

Chris Steele and the fire union are not â€œbogeymenâ€ or â€œscapegoatsâ€ for all the cityâ€™s woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the cityâ€™s long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those citiesâ€™ public safety pension funds essentially went bust).

At least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that itâ€™s irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and itâ€™s the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. Sheâ€™ll get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.

Phoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where â€œat least itâ€™s a dry heat.â€ Similarly, itâ€™s up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.",Y,Y

Really though. When you do a search for Uber cease and desist, you get a huge list of cities fighting Uber. What that tells me is that all this fear that tech companies or young people wanting to move here will see our city as backwards is just bullshit from the Uber lobby.

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up.

(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either. 



&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'.

THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote.

34557037992,"It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it's left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn't have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don't. 

Yes, it's more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren't the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don't know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren't enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.

The answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn't an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.

Texas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?

The state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)

Treâ€¦ lost major points in my book when all their pasta has started coming out salty. Took my mom and dad there for a lunch treat during restaurant weeks and ordered the wine pairing. It was a glass of wine with each of the three courses. When the waiter failed to bring out one of the glasses of wine, and we asked for it, he told me that there were only wine pairings for two of the three courses. We asked for the menus and he said it was clearly stated there were only two and walked away. Never saw the menus. Had to google their lunch time restaurant weeks menu and show himâ€¦ which then prompted him to bring us that wine. Mind you- still got charged. No discount, nothing, after having to argue with the waiter. Soâ€¦ that and the incredibly salty pasta of lateâ€¦ kinda ruined it for me. And it truly was my favorite spot in town!",N,N

Are you talking about Facebook? I don't like it...I don't use it. I use Reddit. I am interested in the people who contribute to the San Antonio Reddit. If it is a meeting setup on Facebook it should be labeled as a Facebook San Antonio meetup maybe?

""Facebook just has better tools to pan with. Jeez.""

I don't really understand how. Lets use WHERE WE WILL MEET as what I think Reddit provides as well as Facebook. 

Saturday, June 9th

6:30PM - 9:30PM

Little Woodrow's - Lounge area

2535 Babcock Rd.

San Antonio, TX 78229
SEE YOU THERE!!

""Plus like the other guy says (sic) it's not anonymous. For instance people aren't just gonna talk shit or be rude like reddit seems to being (sic) out in people.""

I think that the excitement of the meetup would to get to know people in which we are all anonymous. Yet we know why we are there. We can give our handles or we can chose not to. PM me. If there is a physical fight between redditors because there is an asshole bully at the meetup. I will hand you a crisp twenty dollar bill.

I don't want to be a dick to my city folk. I want to meet and find common love. But if it is done through Facebook and other cities then WTF are we doing here?

26487310020,"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy .

That's all changed I feel like over the last 5 years.  Even after I came back to SA after college there wasn't much to do in San Antonio.  Every bar seemed to be located in a strip mall.  Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

When workers are atomized into individual contract signers with employers it creates a vast power imbalance.

Without any unions, you get a race to the bottom as profit-seeking drives downward pressure on wages.

The only exceptions are high skilled, high in-demand industries (like tech) where workers can get away with demanding high salaries.

A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

More than likely now, women will just google which OTC pills can cause abortions/miscarriages and go for that. A more modern clothes hanger.",N,N

This year our theme is Fantasy/RPG, so we've got this big ticket Final Fantasy concert and related. There are a lot of people coming out for that who are interested in the franchise and/or orchestral music (https://ffnewworld.com/concert/sanjapan/). 

Speaking of music, there are a lot of people who come out for our musical guests. Entrance to Teddyloid's set and the ALL OFF concert are both included with the badge you purchase. Give 'em a listen, if you're into that.

We've got a lot of gaming content, as well! Video, board, table top, card, whatever, you name it. Not only do we have free play areas where you can enjoy things with friends (or make new ones), we've got scheduled tournaments as well. And we even have this neat retro game museum that people are free to peruse and even play a few consoles in.

Plus, I know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetups/panels (which again, aren't just restricted to anime fandoms). If you're really curious, I'd suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule (http://san-japan.org/events/schedule) to see if there are things there you might be interested in. Note that doesn't contain our gaming schedules, or the stuff that's open regularly like karaoke or the retro game museum. 

Also, there are also a lot of people who go just to enjoy/interact with/take pictures of the really awesome cosplays we get. I don't always know the fandoms, but we can all appreciate a well made cosplay. The cosplay show is wildly popular.

I know literally the most basic of basics about anime. Like, Dragon Ball Z and Sailor Moon are about as far as I ever really got.

31423258234,"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.

35665222429,"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I donâ€™t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me â€” besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide â€œEmergencyâ€ is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, Iâ€™m not strawman-ing if itâ€™s true, right?  Iâ€™m not basing my entire  argument on this point, Iâ€™m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And thatâ€™s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (Iâ€™m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didnâ€™t accuse me of this, but Iâ€™d still like to say that Iâ€™m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didnâ€™t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",N,Y

In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once. But the state public utility commission also contributed by setting the ERCOT price at $9,000 per megawatt-hour and keeping it there for a week, ensuring that bills for some Texans would skyrocket.

Hand outs ? Itâ€™s not a handout when youâ€™re being exploited by bullshit profit driven companies that looked at our situation and immediately realized how much profit they could make off people in desperate situations.

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If thereâ€™s a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbiâ€™s houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled â€œThe Jews will not replace usâ€ while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during Trumpâ€™s presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I canâ€™t be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and thatâ€™s terrifying to me.

But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)

So in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google.

No? Then you wouldn't mind if I installed cameras there, good citizen? And you claim you aren't doing anything illegal? Did you exceed the speed limit by 1 MPH today? Did you wait exactly 3 seconds at every stop light? Did you wander 1 inch out of your lane? Did you forget to signal somewhere? Break some minor statute you've never heard of? We have the technology to mail you a ticket dozens of times a day for every minuscule infraction you ever make, we could build a perfect police state/nanny state, but it won't be possible without hoards of Americans claiming ""if you are innocent you have nothing to hide.""",N,Y

You could talk to TWC and see if they will take over the line.  They can cut it, strip for a new end, and it back to a splicer on their box.  That way, you can move the modem to your second room to hook up to your router.  From the second room, your can run one ethernet cable to your bedroom.  It's less intrusive than running three lines to the other room.  If they don't want to take it over, then you can inquire how much it would be to just add another drop.  Keep a calm and professional voice and they'll do it for free as a means of keeping you as a customer.

If you're worried about aesthetics/cable management and want to stick to the original setup (running three lines to the second room instead), you might want to go to through the professional route.  Running three lines outside of the walls can end up being hectic.  You could inquired about costs for installing drops from one room to another.

That's literally what arguing semantics is. You tried to argue the definition of ""taco stand"" because nothing else you said held water.

&gt; I'm from the south side... blah blah blah

No one gives a shit about your life story.

&gt; Then you said it was a shitty chain. Okay? I ddnt bring that up either. 

Reading comprehension is important. I know you wanted to smash out a response as fast as you could, but you should actually read what I wrote.

This right here is gold. It gets right to the point: you didn't read anything I wrote before you made a fool of yourself. 

&gt; I told you my definition of a tacot and an you've still not defined yours.

Your definition of a taco stand is a food truck. If you think that is the only place Mexican street food comes from then you don't know anything about tacos. I even asked you to google taco stands to see if people use the term to refer to restaurants. Obviously you didn't do this or you would realize that your narrow definition of taco stand isn't the same as everyone else's definition.

&gt; Googling ""San Antonio taco stand"" gives me a list of mom and pop places that people usually praise. 

Oh shit. You did do it. And you found that people don't just mean ""food truck"" when they say taco stand. Will you learn from this?

I guess not. Aggressive ignorance here.

Guess what? Assume everyone in the left lane travels at 90mph and all the right lanes travel at 65mph. Eventually youâ€™re going to have to get over and exit 9 times out of 10. When is it safe to merge into a lane thatâ€™s going 20-30 mph slower than you? Especially without drastically slowing down traffic in â€œthe fast laneâ€. It doesnâ€™t work. 

Automotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. Thatâ€™s not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldnâ€™t be bothered to have just left earlier. 

I will say that there are some roads that are designed to have people driving at those higher speeds, the majority of San Antonio roads are not those roads. Especially near loops, highway interchanges, and exits. Theyâ€™re designed to slow down traffic before merging with other traffic. In most cases, this will happen in the right lanes. In parts of San Antonio like downtown, there are exits and road changes on the left.",N,N

39245321922," Well, the idea is not that everyone could walk, bike, or take a scooter, but that by allowing more people to walk, bike, take the bus, etc, it alleviates traffic and encourages dense communities vs sprawl. 

Definitely not impossible. I remember some people from the office of sustainability came to my urban planning class in college, they had a million ideas to improve things. Problem is that implementation is quashed by business, state government, NIMBYs, etc. 

I think it's naive to say that SA will ever have fewer drivers than other forms of commuters, but it is definitely possible to improve things.

You should do some research, for instance super blocks in Barcelona. There are other countries tackling similar problems and doing it well. I think part of the solution is dispelling the idea that public transportation inherently has to work to get people to and from every corner of the city. I live downtown. I have no reason to see the 80 millionth taco bell that just opened up next to a new subdivision. Creating walkable districts  with a few connecting routes to get to other areas of the city could be a great compromise. If we encourage businesses to move back downtown, that creates an easy way to move lots of people to and from their place of work along central arteries. 

There are ways to help things, to move to a better future. They're just hard so we don't do them.

Just a reminder, vote Democrat in November and sky high prices for everything is what they assume you want.  They constantly talk about getting rid of petroleum with no viable alternative on the horizon.  Crazy high prices are the result when fuel costs almost triple.

They're starting to talk about getting rid of the ""Trump tax cuts"".  Ignore the media lies about ""tax cuts for the rich"" and look at your personal tax returns and taxes paid over the past 5 years.  I now pay around $4k less in taxes as an independent contractor making average household income after the tax cuts passed.

The end goal of the Establishment's inflationary policy is obvious to those who pay attention, ruin the dollar to get us on the same Blockchain Central Bank Digital Currency that nearly every other country's oligarchy is currently working towards together.  This would signal the end of freedom and usher in absolute technocratic fascism where the government would be able to limit your purchases based on how they want you to think and act.  We are so very close to the precipice and they think they are so very sneaky, but this path is plain as day and has been for a few years now.

The top Republicans are scumbags who want this end too, but they won't act as quickly to get there because they seem to not have the same level of audacity to spit in their voters' faces and gaslight them about things they say they do want they actually do the opposite.

28011962983,"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here.

* Mega corps like facebook and twitter are guilty of creating monopolies and censoring dissent at the behest of the left to interfere with the election.
* Mega corps like Amazon and Walmart supported the lockdowns to kill small business and force people under their thumb and destroy the middle class.
* CRT is a racist belief system that should be banned from government funded training and schools.
* Middle east intervention needs to cease; Bush and Obama are both equally as guilty of it.
* The drug war is racist and should be abolished.
* There's nothing wrong with gay marriage.
* Trans people don't belong in gender segregated sport systems.

Additionally, positions for fully remote are way more competitive. This might also impact the amount of denials.

Iâ€™m not sure about paying someone to optimize your resume. I would recommend tailoring your resumes for the roles youâ€™re applying to and definitely include keywords that align with the position.

I'm not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would've hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn't care what the cost of production is, it's only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.

I love nuclear plants, they're an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \* 72 hrs \* $9,000/MWh = \~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.",Y,Y

- This post is about an employer imposing this rule, not the government. It's an 'at will' employment state. Their company, their choice... they can fire you for any or no reason at all. They can probably do lots of things that the workers may not like.
- Vaccines aren't *just* about your body, you can harbor the disease, grow it in your body, allow it to mutate, and then spread it to others. So it's more like... your safety, my choice. 

I get the whole, its not as thoroughly vetted as other things... but the tech has been so heavily researched, and it has been quite rigorously tested.

Congratulations. Now remember that 1/6 San Antonians (25yo or older) dropped out of high school. Only 1/3 ever finished college. We're [pretty close to the bottom](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2014/02/san-antonio-ranks-near-the-bottom-in-national.html) of educational attainment.

The President isn't wearing a mask. Neither is the Vice President. What's he supposed to do? Copy the most powerful people in the country I suppose.

Like it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy. Or maybe they just listen to the President because ""he has all the info he needs.""

I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency.

Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput.

Changing the filter is never a really bad idea if it needs changing BUT unless it is completely clogged with crap it's not going to make that big a difference.

Also, what is on the coil?  Is it dirt?  That implies a bigger problem if it's dirt and dust buildup.  A problem with the ducts.  Is it growth they are cleaning off?  If so it's going to be back and it's probably permeated every single part of that HVAC system ( including the ducts and their home ).  That requires a whole slew of other things to actually fix the problem.

Two reasons to ice up.  Low on refrigerant and bad airflow.  Two reasons for low refrigerant is a leak or not charged up right to begin with ( how old is the system? ).  Bad airflow is usually a fan problem but can be (rarely) an obstruction problem.

In no way does cleaning the coil and/or changing the filter going to fix those problems and there is a huge possibility that they damage the coil trying to clean it which means big bucks.

The best thing to do is call a professional and find out what the real problem is.  It should take a competent tech about 20 minutes to give a system a once over and another 15-20 to check the refrigerant levels.  In an hour a competent tech can tell you exactly what's wrong.

Call a professional.  Also, sign up for a maintenance plan.  At a minimum they will come out every year ( some do twice a year ) and clean your outdoor coil, check all the electrical systems, check airflow, and give you a list of things that are

A) immediate needs

B) near future needs

The company I worked for also gave a free leak test if the system was low and they were on a maintenance plan.  This way we could identify the problem early and get it handled before it went from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

First thing I did when my wife and I bought our house in 2019 was install a good filtration system ( the 1 inch filters are complete dogshit ) that uses 3 inch filters that are replaced once a year ( google aprilaire ) and a complete UV system to destroy anything that might grow inside the system.  Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.  Other than regular maintenance costs ( replacing bulbs/filters etc ) our systems will be going strong for a good bit longer than the average 11-12 years in our climate.",Y,N

The company I worked for also gave a free leak test if the system was low and they were on a maintenance plan.  This way we could identify the problem early and get it handled before it went from hundreds to thousands of dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing I did when my wife and I bought our house in 2019 was install a good filtration system ( the 1 inch filters are complete dogshit ) that uses 3 inch filters that are replaced once a year ( google aprilaire ) and a complete UV system to destroy anything that might grow inside the system.  Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.  Other than regular maintenance costs ( replacing bulbs/filters etc ) our systems will be going strong for a good bit longer than the average 11-12 years in our climate.",Y,N

28640274513,"It doesn't help that the DoD has faced some significant budget cuts over the past several years and contracting has been severely restricted. The San Antonio tech economy is very closely tied to the budgetary health of the military, and the military is at the lowest levels of staffing since their inception. 

On the bright side, civilian hiring has also been at an all time low the past several years, so when the military does need to ramp up operations in support of some future conflict (or if Congress and the Executive decide that it would be politically expedient to restore DoD funding levels) there will be a rapid ramp up in IT contracting as we can't hire civil servants nearly as quickly, nor do we really have positions for highly technical civilian employees anymore.
