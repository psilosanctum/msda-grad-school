When I was working; I was fine because I would literally be working 10-12 hours a day, get home, make something to eat, watch some Netflix or play video games, go to sleep, and repeat.  Not a whole lot of interactions except to organize a family movie night at a theater with my brother as well and not having it be so late for us to still go to bed and wake up the next morning at 5 or so...\n\nNow I'm taking some online classes in computer science and business so I can hopefully learn and be able land something to be able to still work from home and making a pay check next time something like this happens.  I work for a wholesale business that delivers liquor to bars and restaurants - but when they shut down, business went down as well and we were out of a job for a week.  Luckily, our boss was also opening up 2 new stores before all this and is giving us some work to do to both help them out as well as us whenever this clears out and we can hit the ground running better prepared.  They're still going to pay us our full amount that we were getting before, just a different kind of work.  Still work.""",N,N

Even if it is as you say it is (it isn\'t), it doesn\'t make up for the principal of the fact. True, google\'s algorithms can figure out a lot. Wtf do you think the government is using?! Bringing up how bad other governments are doesn\'t make what the government is doing ""okay"". If anything, the government knows that keeping it\'s people comfortable allows them far more freedom to fuck over other countries than if they wanted to treat us like they were N.Korea.\n\nPeople will fight for their fake ""freedom"" (usa) a lot harder than for an imposing government (n.korea) (staying within the confines of your examples).\n\nThis all goes much deeper, and we\'re hardly doing any side of the argument justice, here.

I I had a room that was always warmer than all the others  called the A/C company to check it out (within the first year) and they showed up with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to get different readings to tell me it was within spec.  They also threw in other nonsensical reasons like getting more sun than other rooms (even though it shared a wall with two other bedrooms that didnt have cooling issues).  Basically they gave me a big list of reasons why they shouldnt have to do any actual work.  Note that at no point did they even look at the unit or duct work in the attic.\n\n  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  \n\nIt would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking it meets specs and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didnt stop to consider anything else.'",N,N

During the trial, it emerged that Williams  while pimping Amber and Cooper  was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Defense attorney Paul J.

Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper\'s as part of an upgrade.\n&gt; \n&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that\'s what men do,"" Williams testified.\n&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn\'t. But under state law, physical force isn\'t required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn\'t a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man.

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems.

36511971386,"b'&gt; One if the best explanations I\'ve seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8\n\nI\'ll have to watch that at home. It\'s blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn\'t think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it\'s a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)\n(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  \n\ntl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It\'s a trickle-up effect. \n\n\n\n&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don\'t function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.\n\nI agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that\'s merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I\'m trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. \n\n\nTrump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there\'s so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. \nWe spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.\n&gt; \n\nWell, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. \n\nUltimately I think we\'re in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don\'t accidentally give large corporations more money.  That\'s punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That\'s not good either. \n\n\n\n&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?\n\n\nUhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.

34557037992,"b'It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it\'s left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn\'t have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don\'t. \n\nYes, it\'s more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren\'t the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don\'t know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren\'t enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.\n\nThe answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn\'t an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.\n\nTexas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?\n\nThe state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)\n\n[Texas DSHS Hospitals State Wide Capacity](https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/0d8bdf9be927459d9cb11b9eaef6101f)\n\nApologies if that was rambly and repetitive, I\'m getting tired but want to get those posted.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. \nYes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. \nSo what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  \nYou're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  \nDrug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. \nI don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. \nMoney: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. \nYou want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.""",N,n

29390398784,"b""I think this is pretty spot on.  Around 10 years ago I had left San Antonio to go to school in Austin and at the time San Antonio couldn't hold a candle to the type of young urban life someone living in Austin could have.  \n\nThat's all changed I feel like over the last 5 years.  Even after I came back to SA after college there wasn't much to do in San Antonio.  Every bar seemed to be located in a strip mall.  Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.\n\nI feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.\n\nTech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.\n\nI ended up in Austin for tech, but visit San Antonio regularly and see all the changes that have occurred.  My career and future is most likely in Austin but I would love to move back to San Antonio for the culture that's been revitalized over the last few years.""",N,N

Without any unions, you get a race to the bottom as profit-seeking drives downward pressure on wages.\n\nThe only exceptions are high skilled, high in-demand industries (like tech) where workers can get away with demanding high salaries.

A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.\n\nIf the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.\n\nMore than likely now, women will just google which OTC pills can cause abortions/miscarriages and go for that.

And we even have this neat retro game museum that people are free to peruse and even play a few consoles in.\n\nPlus, I know a lot of people who go just to participate in fandom meetups/panels (which again, aren't just restricted to anime fandoms). If you're really curious, I'd suggest taking a quick peek at the schedule (http://san-japan.org/events/schedule) to see if there are things there you might be interested in.

Because people who take the toll roads are literally paying to get places faster. 85mph is not safe when the majority of people around you are going 65. \n\nGuess what? Assume everyone in the left lane travels at 90mph and all the right lanes travel at 65mph. Eventually youre going to have to get over and exit 9 times out of 10. When is it safe to merge into a lane thats going 20-30 mph slower than you? Especially without drastically slowing down traffic in the fast lane. It doesnt work. \n\nAutomotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. Thats not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesnt mean youre immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldnt be bothered to have just left earlier. \n\nI will say that there are some roads that are designed to have people driving at those higher speeds, the majority of San Antonio roads are not those roads.

Problem is that implementation is quashed by business, state government, NIMBYs, etc. \n\nI think it's naive to say that SA will ever have fewer drivers than other forms of commuters, but it is definitely possible to improve things.\n\nYou should do some research, for instance super blocks in Barcelona.

I have no reason to see the 80 millionth taco bell that just opened up next to a new subdivision. Creating walkable districts  with a few connecting routes to get to other areas of the city could be a great compromise. If we encourage businesses to move back downtown, that creates an easy way to move lots of people to and from their place of work along central arteries. \n\nThere are ways to help things, to move to a better future.

Clearly your claim that it is necessary to wildly overvalue executive skills is not correct.\n\nFurther, I'm arguing that the US has a very bad culture of wildly overvaluing executive skills. They're valuable and require training, I certainly don't deny that, but computer programmers are at least as difficult to find and train as executives (I'd argue more difficult), and they aren't paid nearly as much. Clearly something is going on beyond supply and demand here, and I'd argue that it's the fact that American executives realized that basically they set their own wages so they started jacking them up.\n\nBack in the 1950's the average CEO made only around 12x what the lowest paid worker in their company did and the economy did quite well at that time. \n\nThe argument that one must shower executives with insanely huge salaries does not seem valid.""",N,N

I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. Youre still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels youre using.
