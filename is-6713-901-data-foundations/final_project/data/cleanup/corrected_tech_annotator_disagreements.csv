If you dont like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.\n\nMunicipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and Im not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, thats something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.\n\nChris Steele and the fire union are not bogeymen or scapegoats for all the citys woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the citys long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities public safety pension funds essentially went bust).\n\nAt least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that its irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and its the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. Shell get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.\n\nPhoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where at least its a dry heat. Similarly, its up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.'",Y,N,Y

26487310020,"b'&gt; Saying ""don\'t bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.\n\nNonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won\'t live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it\'d take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city\'s so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?\n\nGoogle is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN\'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they\'d have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can\'t make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won\'t be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city\'s quirky demographics couldn\'t make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn\'t a good place to try an overbuild.\n\n(edit. added a few words for clarity)'",Y,n,Y

But an answer is as simple as filing a handwritten note, just make sure it has the correct cause number on it and you sign it. \n\nFilings are done through e-file these days, but that requires setting up an account and paying for it. Thats probably not practical for you considering youre not in the business of regularly filing documents with the court. \n\nJudging by the 14 day deadline you referenced, Im assuming your suit was filed in JP court. Contact the court clerk and ask if you can file by fax or in person. Im not sure how JP courts are operating right now during COVID nor the chances someone will actually answer the phone. You may need to do this in person. Here is the link for JP courts https://www.bexar.org/3145/Justice-of-the-Peace\n\nLastly, youre gonna need to speak with the plaintiff sooner or later. You should have been served with a petition signed by the attorney. Call him/her to discuss the case.

31423258234,"b'Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let\'s say it\'s one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  \nSo....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  \nStop at stop signs.  \nStop at red lights.  \nUse turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  \nWhether you are consistently balanced.  \nWhen and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  \nIf you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you\'re on the walk.  \nAs far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  \nJust a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  \n\nI believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of \'wtf are you doing?\' \'Watch where you\'re going!\'   \n\nIf users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  \n\nAnd, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you\'re a regular user. But if it\'s under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  \n\nThere are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.  \n\nI rode in traffic at 4ish afternoon couple days ago on Alamo heading south.  I wasnt entirely scared as drivers seem to know to give fair way and buffer space. But it was a little scary on that little thing.  '",N,y,Y

35665222429,"b'Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. \n\nWhat constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I dont know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  \nHouses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me  besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide Emergency is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.\n\nRegarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, Im not strawman-ing if its true, right?  Im not basing my entire  argument on this point, Im just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And thats just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (Im actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)\n\nThe exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.\n\nYou didnt accuse me of this, but Id still like to say that Im not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didnt vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.'",N,Y,Y

In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once. But the state public utility commission also contributed by setting the ERCOT price at $9,000 per megawatt-hour and keeping it there for a week, ensuring that bills for some Texans would skyrocket.\n\nHand outs ?

In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.\n\nOn top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. \n\nI still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. \n\nThere are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. """,N,Y,Y

Even after this event, nobody wants to be stuck selling $120/MWh cost electricity into a $30/MWh market.\n\nI\'m not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would\'ve hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn\'t care what the cost of production is, it\'s only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.\n\nI love nuclear plants, they\'re an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \\* 72 hrs \\* $9,000/MWh = \\~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.'",Y,N,Y

And honestly, taking it to a store for ""repairs"" is a bit roundabout.\n\nI based my information on an actual quote I was given(from dr.phonez no less, so yea) for a repair of a phone I broke(that I got fixed for free by the manufacturer anyways by researching it)\n\n\nI myself, also offered an alternative solution, I only brought up an opinion based solely on my experience with these sorts of issues.

Im not saying transit is a magic bullet but its logical that diversifying transportation options would be helpful. At least in my mind, isnt making everyone drive a personal vehicle in order to go anywhere akin to government mandated car ownership? Cant hold a job, go to school, shop, live unless you can travel to those places. \n\nTransportation is just the tip of the iceberg though. Transit fails for any number of reasons, but the top may as well be that our preferred urban development patterns cant support it. Low density, sprawling, disconnected places dont lend themselves to people walking or biking to a place they can get in a bus or train. I could keep going but I suspect its wasted here.'",Y,N,N
