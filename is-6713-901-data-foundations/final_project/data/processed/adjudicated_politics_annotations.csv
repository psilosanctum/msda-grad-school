Amber\'s mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber\'s head. She fell down and played dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Miraculously, all survived.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women\'s shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.\n&gt; \n&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Williams\n&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams  while pimping Amber and Cooper  was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper\'s as part of an upgrade.\n&gt; \n&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that\'s what men do,"" Williams testified.\n&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn\'t. But under state law, physical force isn\'t required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn\'t a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn\'t done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""\n&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; The jury came back with 50.\n&gt; \n&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville.

She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.\n&gt; \n&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.\n&gt; \n&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I\'m just tired of running.

Also in the court record are Amber\'s handwritten notes describing her life under Williams\' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts.

34557037992,"b'It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it\'s left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn\'t have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don\'t. \n\nYes, it\'s more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren\'t the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don\'t know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren\'t enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.\n\nThe answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn\'t an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.\n\nTexas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?\n\nThe state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. \nYes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. \nSo what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  \nYou're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  \nDrug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. \nI don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. \nMoney: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. \nYou want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?

Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  \n\nI believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of \'wtf are you doing?\' \'Watch where you\'re going!\'   \n\nIf users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  \n\nAnd, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you\'re a regular user. But if it\'s under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  \n\nThere are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.  \n\nI rode in traffic at 4ish afternoon couple days ago on Alamo heading south.

It doesnt work. \n\nAutomotive technology has nothing to do with anything. Cars can go above 75mph. Thats not news. Seat belts and air bags help but that doesnt mean youre immune to impacts at nearly 100mph. And even if you lived from a wreck at that speed, you probably injured others in the process of your stupid need to get somewhere 5 minutes earlier when the solution lies with the fact that you couldnt be bothered to have just left earlier. \n\nI will say that there are some roads that are designed to have people driving at those higher speeds, the majority of San Antonio roads are not those roads. Especially near loops, highway interchanges, and exits. Theyre designed to slow down traffic before merging with other traffic. In most cases, this will happen in the right lanes. In parts of San Antonio like downtown, there are exits and road changes on the left.'",N,Y,N

28011962983,"b""I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.\n\nOn top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. \n\nI still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. \n\nThere are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. """,Y,N,N

Even after this event, nobody wants to be stuck selling $120/MWh cost electricity into a $30/MWh market.\n\nI\'m not sure what ""price shock"" you think natural gas producers caused?  They were definitely elevated, but the [day-ahead market prices](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/html/20210215_dam_spp) were under the offer cap price limit.  The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would\'ve hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn\'t care what the cost of production is, it\'s only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.\n\nI love nuclear plants, they\'re an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \\* 72 hrs \\* $9,000/MWh = \\~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.'",Y,N,N
