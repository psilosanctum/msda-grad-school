Personally I'd install benchmarks,  check for  acceptable levels of light bleed,  make sure I'm satisfied with idle temps,  check all of the keys and the flex in the keyboard.  If you're not happy with the computer during those 15  days you can return it for a refund or swap it for a different computer.  You have even longer if you're an elite member. Walmart's return policy is good too,  but if you buy online you have to make sure the seller is Walmart and you have to wait for them to receive the return before you get refunded.  That usually takes a week or so for the refund to hit your account.  Same with Amazon.  Sellers like Antonline have a poor return policy and I'd avoid buying from them unless they have a really good deal and you know what you're buying.",,,40414551381
