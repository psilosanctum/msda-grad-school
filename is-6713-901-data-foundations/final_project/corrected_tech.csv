How the city manager navigates those constraints while making city government as effective as possible is no small feat. Sheryl Sculley has shown that shes been able to do this quite well.\n\nBut its extremely important to keep in mind that the city manager, by design, does not set policy. Policies such as city ordinances and the budget are set by city council. If you dont like the policies in place, then every two years you have a chance to vote for someone who will change them.\n\nMunicipal fiber may not be allowed by state law (many states have effectively banned it and Im not certain if Texas is one of them), and even if it is, thats something city council has to do decide to do and city residents will also need to accept a tax increase for that. For the private sector, Google Fiber hit quite a lot of neighborhood opposition to the infrastructure they needed to install to run a fiber network and Google consequently curtailed their deployment. City council did not act to try to better balance the needs for high-tech infrastructure with the interests of neighborhoods so the city tossed away that opportunity. The city council gets elected every two years so this is a reflection of the will of the voters.\n\nChris Steele and the fire union are not bogeymen or scapegoats for all the citys woes. They do bear responsibility for actively harming the interests of city residents in the pursuit of their own narrow interests for some recent issues. They are manipulating populist sentiment in ways that harm the citys long-term prospects just for some short-term gains for themselves. They want the city to be saddled with unsustainable healthcare and retirement costs which benefit people who are already retired, or will be soon, without any regard to the fact that future firefighter retirees will likely get screwed. Look at Houston and Dallas for examples of what happens when cities negotiate overly-generous pension benefits for public safety workers that turned out to be unrealistic (both of those cities public safety pension funds essentially went bust).\n\nAt least San Antonio has a city manager that identified that its irresponsible to negotiate generous benefit packages with public safety unions without regard to the long-term cost. She dared to suggest slowly reigning in those costs in ways that would have as little impact on public safety employees as possible while balancing the fiscal needs of the city and the residents who fund it. Too bad that made her a target for the union and its the residents of San Antonio who will bear the consequences. Shell get a nice, well-deserved retirement while the city and its residents will face the costs of what it voted for.\n\nPhoenix residents voted for policies, including increased taxes on themselves, and elected leaders that would start to steer the city away from merely being a destination for retirees and those seeking cheap housing where at least its a dry heat. Similarly, its up to San Antonio residents to make this city a better place to live for themselves when they go to the ballot box.'",Y

Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.\n\nGMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.\n\nBuilding datacenters is not CPS\'s bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it\'s their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I\'m curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.\n\nThe best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it\'s scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.\n\nOn top of that, no one who\'s sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. \n\n&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)\n\n*DISCLAIMER*: I am a Rackspace employee.'",Y

31423258234,"b'Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let\'s say it\'s one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  \nSo....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  \nStop at stop signs.  \nStop at red lights.  \nUse turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  \nWhether you are consistently balanced.  \nWhen and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  \nIf you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you\'re on the walk.  \nAs far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  \nJust a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  \n\nI believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of \'wtf are you doing?\' \'Watch where you\'re going!\'   \n\nIf users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  \n\nAnd, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you\'re a regular user. But if it\'s under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  \n\nThere are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.  \n\nI rode in traffic at 4ish afternoon couple days ago on Alamo heading south.

35665222429,"b'Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. \n\nWhat constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I dont know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  \nHouses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me  besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide Emergency is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.\n\nRegarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, Im not strawman-ing if its true, right?  Im not basing my entire  argument on this point, Im just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And thats just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (Im actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)\n\nThe exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.\n\nYou didnt accuse me of this, but Id still like to say that Im not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didnt vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.'",Y

In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once.

And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.\n\nOn top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. \n\nI still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. \n\nThere are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here.

34649047223,"b'&gt; People love to blame our politicians for not giving us the proper restrictions, but I and most reasonably responsible people I know, including basically my entire family, have self-quarantined, worn masks in public, and kept up with social distancing since before anyone was really ordering restrictions.\n\nCongratulations. Now remember that 1/6 San Antonians (25yo or older) dropped out of high school. Only 1/3 ever finished college. We\'re [pretty close to the bottom](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2014/02/san-antonio-ranks-near-the-bottom-in-national.html) of educational attainment.\n\nSo you figure some dude with only a high school diploma is wondering what to do in a pandemic. He can google random shit and maybe he\'ll find a trustworthy site; maybe not. Did he ever learn how to do that?\n\nThe President isn\'t wearing a mask. Neither is the Vice President. What\'s he supposed to do? Copy the most powerful people in the country I suppose.\n\nLike it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy. Or maybe they just listen to the President because ""he has all the info he needs.""\n\nThe absolute *most important* job the President has is to set the tone of the country. There\'s a reason this country went to fucking shit and everyone is miserable under Trump and it\'s because he set a terrible tone that has destroyed people\'s psyches.'",Y

37628754168,"b""Yep.  It does nothing to actually diagnose and solve the problem.  Having a lay person do those things gives the potential for them to seriously damage the coil.  Changing the filter is never a really bad idea if it needs changing BUT unless it is completely clogged with crap it's not going to make that big a difference.\n\nAlso, what is on the coil?  Is it dirt?  That implies a bigger problem if it's dirt and dust buildup.  A problem with the ducts.  Is it growth they are cleaning off?  If so it's going to be back and it's probably permeated every single part of that HVAC system ( including the ducts and their home ).  That requires a whole slew of other things to actually fix the problem.\n\nTwo reasons to ice up.  Low on refrigerant and bad airflow.  Two reasons for low refrigerant is a leak or not charged up right to begin with ( how old is the system? ).  Bad airflow is usually a fan problem but can be (rarely) an obstruction problem.\n\nIn no way does cleaning the coil and/or changing the filter going to fix those problems and there is a huge possibility that they damage the coil trying to clean it which means big bucks.\n\nThe best thing to do is call a professional and find out what the real problem is.  It should take a competent tech about 20 minutes to give a system a once over and another 15-20 to check the refrigerant levels.  In an hour a competent tech can tell you exactly what's wrong.\n\nCall a professional.  Also, sign up for a maintenance plan.  At a minimum they will come out every year ( some do twice a year ) and clean your outdoor coil, check all the electrical systems, check airflow, and give you a list of things that are\n\nA) immediate needs\n\nB) near future needs\n\nC) optional improvements to your system\n\nThe company I worked for also gave a free leak test if the system was low and they were on a maintenance plan.  This way we could identify the problem early and get it handled before it went from hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst thing I did when my wife and I bought our house in 2019 was install a good filtration system ( the 1 inch filters are complete dogshit ) that uses 3 inch filters that are replaced once a year ( google aprilaire ) and a complete UV system to destroy anything that might grow inside the system.  Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.  Other than regular maintenance costs ( replacing bulbs/filters etc ) our systems will be going strong for a good bit longer than the average 11-12 years in our climate.""",Y

She fell down and played dead.\n&gt; \n&gt; Miraculously, all survived.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women\'s shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.\n&gt; \n&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Williams\n&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.\n&gt; \n&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams  while pimping Amber and Cooper  was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.\n&gt; \n&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper\'s as part of an upgrade.\n&gt; \n&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that\'s what men do,"" Williams testified.\n&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn\'t. But under state law, physical force isn\'t required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn\'t a minor.\n&gt; \n&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn\'t done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""\n&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; The jury came back with 50.\n&gt; \n&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville.

She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.\n&gt; \n&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.\n&gt; \n&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I\'m just tired of running.

Also in the court record are Amber\'s handwritten notes describing her life under Williams\' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts.

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems.

36511971386,"b'&gt; One if the best explanations I\'ve seen in regards to why the 15 minimum wage needs to be deeply reviewed before implementation.\n&gt; \n&gt; https://youtu.be/RZiFdfxXxn8\n\nI\'ll have to watch that at home. It\'s blocked here for hate speech or inflammatory content.  (didn\'t think youtube allowed that?! - my company is pretty conservative though so maybe it\'s a tenacious sysadmin adding shit to the filter?)\n(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  \n\ntl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It\'s a trickle-up effect. \n\n\n\n&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don\'t function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.\n\nI agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that\'s merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I\'m trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. \n\n\nTrump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there\'s so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. \nWe spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.\n&gt; \n\nWell, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. \n\nUltimately I think we\'re in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don\'t accidentally give large corporations more money.  That\'s punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That\'s not good either. \n\n\n\n&gt; It makes THEM money, not the private citizen. I always find it ironic the left is ""fighting fascism and the establishment"" when mainstream media, social media, big tech, higher and lower education are all owned and operated by the left. How much establishment is left to fight against?\n\n\nUhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. \n\nThe very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they\'re successful in keeping it hidden from \'common knowledge\'. \n\nI\'m a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don\'t have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that\'s why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. \n\nMake people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It\'s a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. \n\n&gt; \n&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don\'t elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don\'t. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You\'re telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.\n\nThis is what I\'ve been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you\'re against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. \n\nI don\'t actually know how little of Trump\'s relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. \nThe part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. \n\nThere are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn\'t COVID related and shouldn\'t be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. \n\nEconomics.  The ultimate ""facts don\'t care about your feelings"" subject.  :D \n\n\nSocialism and communism might have their downside.  I don\'t think we\'ve seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that\'s more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I\'m assuming you\'re American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it\'s a jobs program. \n\n""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we\'ll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". \n\nWe have social security - it\'s in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I\'ll be lucky to never use.   I\'d argue that it works, but could work better.   \n\nIf we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what\'s better for everyone. \n\nNow we just need to keep voting in better politicians who actually have OUR interests at heart, and toss them out the moment their lies and bullshit comes to light.'",N

You learn tons of stuff about many aspects of computing and have a fundamental understanding of things that will allow you to think outside the box.  You can think of it as the difference between a mechanic and someone that designs cars. Very different jobs with very different pay. \nOf course this is just my two cents and your path is your own.

34557037992,"b'It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it\'s left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn\'t have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don\'t. \n\nYes, it\'s more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren\'t the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don\'t know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren\'t enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.\n\nThe answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn\'t an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.\n\nTexas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?\n\nThe state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)\n\n[Texas DSHS Hospitals State Wide Capacity](https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/0d8bdf9be927459d9cb11b9eaef6101f)\n\nApologies if that was rambly and repetitive, I\'m getting tired but want to get those posted.

Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.\n\nGMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.\n\nBuilding datacenters is not CPS\'s bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it\'s their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I\'m curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.\n\nThe best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. \nYes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. \nSo what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  \nYou're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  \nDrug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. \nI don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. \nMoney: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. \nYou want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.""",n

Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it.

This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering.

38538006422,"b'Funny how you say that, since sociology is one of the fields that marxism has decided to influence most of all. Because it is a very soft science, it has been easy for them to influence. But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\\_of\\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)\n\nSo in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google. Sure there is something to it - if someone keen on learning could never get to the library, and if there was no Internet or no book stores, maybe they would never learn anything and become what they can be. But in practice that problem hardly exists. Political measures today is mostly about throwing money away on projects that almost never generate any measurable results, just so politicians can win votes by showing how ""good"" their intentions are.\n\nEnough about that. Again, NO, the reason why many ""homeless"" people has been seen in SA is NOT that the city is too difficult to walk in. On the contrary - criminals who have lost their driving license due to drugs and other crime will move their hustling to cities where the weather is good and it is easy to get around by walking. While people who want to work hard and get a honest career will invest whatever money they could come up with on a car and live in a city with little crime and where honesty and hard work pays off, even if the climate is hard and it is difficult to walk.'",N

They constantly talk about getting rid of petroleum with no viable alternative on the horizon.  Crazy high prices are the result when fuel costs almost triple.\n\nThey\'re starting to talk about getting rid of the ""Trump tax cuts"".  Ignore the media lies about ""tax cuts for the rich"" and look at your personal tax returns and taxes paid over the past 5 years.  I now pay around $4k less in taxes as an independent contractor making average household income after the tax cuts passed.\n\nThe end goal of the Establishment\'s inflationary policy is obvious to those who pay attention, ruin the dollar to get us on the same Blockchain Central Bank Digital Currency that nearly every other country\'s oligarchy is currently working towards together.  This would signal the end of freedom and usher in absolute technocratic fascism where the government would be able to limit your purchases based on how they want you to think and act.  We are so very close to the precipice and they think they are so very sneaky, but this path is plain as day and has been for a few years now.\n\nThe top Republicans are scumbags who want this end too, but they won\'t act as quickly to get there because they seem to not have the same level of audacity to spit in their voters\' faces and gaslight them about things they say they do want they actually do the opposite.\n\nLearn about these things, don\'t take my word for it.  And don\'t use Google (or DuckDuckGo) if you don\'t want the CIA\'s official propaganda.

Downtown is a tourist attraction but it also has a lot of buildings that aren't being used but can be used to attract new technology start-ups there by the city.\n\nThe city needs to basically do everything within their power to attract Google here (especially for Google Fiber).

I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. Youre still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels youre using.

Valet mode limits power and top speed, but also disables autopilot, voice commands, glove box &amp; front trunk access, navigation addresses (saved favorites, home &amp; work addresses, etc.), prevents checking/changing Bluetooth/WiFi settings (e.g. - list of saved devices/WiFi networks), HomeLink (garage/gate remote), history of previous private charging locations, and the ability to see/change most of the settings pages.

Conclusion With up to 6 months of follow-up and despite a gradually declining trend in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728)
