"Holy shit. You really are an idiot. Let me break this down for you. I'll try to use small words you can understand.

&gt; It was never an arguement on semantics. I don't see shitty chain restaurants as taco stands. You obviously have a different definition of taco stand.

That's literally what arguing semantics is. You tried to argue the definition of ""taco stand"" because nothing else you said held water.

&gt; I'm from the south side... blah blah blah

No one gives a shit about your life story.

&gt; Then you said it was a shitty chain. Okay? I ddnt bring that up either. 

Reading comprehension is important. I know you wanted to smash out a response as fast as you could, but you should actually read what I wrote. I said it looks like a chain restaurant and gave an example of a chain restaurant. It was seriously like 1 sentence. Could you not be bothered to read it before you started making shit up?

&gt; You compared it to Firewok. What the hell kinda taco stand doesn't sell tacos? 

This right here is gold. It gets right to the point: you didn't read anything I wrote before you made a fool of yourself. 

&gt; I told you my definition of a tacot and an you've still not defined yours.

Your definition of a taco stand is a food truck. If you think that is the only place Mexican street food comes from then you don't know anything about tacos. I even asked you to google taco stands to see if people use the term to refer to restaurants. Obviously you didn't do this or you would realize that your narrow definition of taco stand isn't the same as everyone else's definition.

&gt; Googling ""San Antonio taco stand"" gives me a list of mom and pop places that people usually praise. 

Oh shit. You did do it. And you found that people don't just mean ""food truck"" when they say taco stand. Will you learn from this?

&gt; So, even following squirrelly patter sheds no light of your idea of a taco stand.

I guess not. Aggressive ignorance here.

&gt; I wanna say I'm sorry for name-calling but your agressive attitude makesh at very difficult.

I forgive you for acting like a child, but not for acting so dumb. No need to blame me for your shortcomings.

&gt; I'm giving you the benfit of not reading outside what you're saying

You aren't even reading what I am saying.

&gt; I meant what I said. Not what you think I meant.

I know what you said. The problem is that it is wrong and you tried to argue the definition of ""taco stand"" rather than to just admit you were acting like a jerk in the first place.

"I think there *are* a couple of differences,

- This post is about an employer imposing this rule, not the government. It's an 'at will' employment state. Their company, their choice... they can fire you for any or no reason at all. They can probably do lots of things that the workers may not like.
- Vaccines aren't *just* about your body, you can harbor the disease, grow it in your body, allow it to mutate, and then spread it to others. So it's more like... your safety, my choice. 

I get the whole, its not as thoroughly vetted as other things... but the tech has been so heavily researched, and it has been quite rigorously tested. The real concern is that this artifically made virus seems very prone to mutating for the worse, and if we simply let it keep moving around, it *will* continue to mutate, and it will likely continue to get worse. and worse, and maybe it won't stay just 0.01% mortality rate. Not to mention, even in survivors, there was some signs of long lasting lung damage and changes to the brain.

"It doesn't help that the DoD has faced some significant budget cuts over the past several years and contracting has been severely restricted. The San Antonio tech economy is very closely tied to the budgetary health of the military, and the military is at the lowest levels of staffing since their inception. 

On the bright side, civilian hiring has also been at an all time low the past several years, so when the military does need to ramp up operations in support of some future conflict (or if Congress and the Executive decide that it would be politically expedient to restore DoD funding levels) there will be a rapid ramp up in IT contracting as we can't hire civil servants nearly as quickly, nor do we really have positions for highly technical civilian employees anymore.

"the thing is, there will always still be someone who will resort to the clothes hanger. A rape victim, someone who is impoverished and won't be able to travel out of state (because we all know Texas is on the path to a full ban), there are many other reasons. Just because BC is legal, and some states will keep abortion legal, doesn't mean that all women will have access to it. Not everyone will help these people, not all women have someone on their side.

If the term abortion is used in it's true umbrella state, it means any pregnancy ended PRIOR to being full term, the fetus and placenta being removed from the uterus. This includes medical abortions for the health of the mother (or potentially a twin baby if one baby is failing in health). This includes abortions for peoples with disabilities who are incapable of taking care of a child yet may have been abused, manipulated and tricked. This includes abortions for those who have been raped, regardless of age or mental capabilities. By saying -no- abortions and leaving the states up to determine what that means (and Texas doesn't care if you've been raped), then it's setting up a lot of vulnerable people up for failure and a lifetime of pain and suffering. All while the people who oppose abortion and rallied for it's ban shake their heads at yet another poor soul leeching out the system, while not offering not so much as a smile.

More than likely now, women will just google which OTC pills can cause abortions/miscarriages and go for that. A more modern clothes hanger.",N,Y,,

"I don't see where I said drug abuse is a new problem.  I'm in my mid 40s I have seen the change in society's behavior and it's alarming . Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy .

The system offer price for electricity is going to vary with supply and demand.  For 15 Feb, demand far outstripped expected supply (forecast &gt;10,000MW during the 0800 hour).  Prices would've hit $9000/MWh even if all the generation online had been nuclear.  The price doesn't care what the cost of production is, it's only a mechanism to balance supply and demand.

I love nuclear plants, they're an amazing technology, but they also have weaknesses.  In this case, a false alarm due to a frozen pressure sensor resulted in a plant being offline for 3 days during a period of critical need.  That $100 heating coil and 1 hour repair cost the plant owners 1350MW \* 72 hrs \* $9,000/MWh = \~$875m  Restarting a nuke after tripping offline is always a slow process due to xenon poisoning.",Y,N,,

I know perfectly well that the internet is not a quote-unquote safe place. I also know that redditors have been extremely helpful in certain situations when people have lost things they are trying to recover. You're making a mountain out of a molehill here when I was simply asking for help. I did not ask anyone to divulge information that wasn't able to be found on Google in the first place but it's a lot faster to ask somebody sometimes been trying to figure it all out yourself when you have no idea how to do it. There was no information divulged to anyone about anything. Nor was I asking anyone too. I was asking if anybody found his phone because he can't post on Reddit because he doesn't have his phone! And then I was asking for help in locking it unlocking it and all that other crap. There was absolutely no personal information about him or his phone number or anything else posted anywhere on Reddit. Like I said y'all are ridiculous. I don't understand how trying to get help for someone is considered stalking and abducting. He asked me to help him. It is perfectly obvious to me who would not help someone in a situation where they needed help. And it's not me.,Y,N,,
"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.

"Tokyo manages just fine paying its mayor (no city manager setup there so the mayor does it) even less than the San Antonio cap. Clearly your claim that it is necessary to wildly overvalue executive skills is not correct.

Further, I'm arguing that the US has a very bad culture of wildly overvaluing executive skills. They're valuable and require training, I certainly don't deny that, but computer programmers are at least as difficult to find and train as executives (I'd argue more difficult), and they aren't paid nearly as much. Clearly something is going on beyond supply and demand here, and I'd argue that it's the fact that American executives realized that basically they set their own wages so they started jacking them up.

Back in the 1950's the average CEO made only around 12x what the lowest paid worker in their company did and the economy did quite well at that time.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other.

"Absolutely. Agree with everything you said. There is no doubt that CPS will need this.

What I question is why build your own datacenter to do this crunching? Just cause I want to use web-based email do I go and spend millions on a datacenter, and hire software developers to do this? Nah, I just sign up for GMail.

GMail is an example of Software as a Service, but Amazon and countless other providers offer Infrastructure as a Server (servers, storage, etc) either on-demand, or you can rent a base load of physical servers and scale out with virtual (cloud) servers.

Building datacenters is not CPS's bag. Hell, not even Netflix thinks it's their bag...all of Netflix is run on servers billed based on hourly usage! Netflix does not run datacenters. I'm curious how someone like CPS needs their own physical datacenters when the biggest names in technology, whose critical business run on datacenter, do not run their own datacenters.

The best part of this is that a cloud/dedicated provider will manage power, cooling, upgrades--all of this administrative overhead--is handled by them. And it's scalable, meaning you can use 10 servers for your day-to-day operations and pay only for, say, 30 more servers for the week that you do billing.

On top of that, no one who's sensible builds datacenters in south Texas. Cooling is expensive, and our baseload electric here is non-renewable and expensive natural gas. The consensus is the industry is to build in areas that are cooler, and where hydroelectric is the predominant generation source. 

&gt; Google and Facebook tend to build their data centers in remote, optimum locations like the Columbia River Valley, where power is cheap, or in central Oregon where the cool nights and high desert climate aid in the fight to keep densely packed computer equipment from overheating."" --[source: Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/how-to-build-a-modern-data-center/d/d-id/1097407)

&gt;*Five Ways To Make Your Resume Sink Faster Than The Titanic*
&gt;
&gt;**5) Proficient in Word, Excel and PowerPoin**t

&gt;This is another case where I do a mental replacement â€“ I swap â€œProficient in Word, Excel and PowerPointâ€ for â€œProficient in Breathing Oxygenâ€ and then wonder what the person was thinking.
&gt;Of all the gaffes listed here, this one might be the most common in resumes Iâ€™ve reviewed. This alone is not enough to â€œsinkâ€ your resume, but I do think you look silly listing programs that virtually everyone who has worked in an office before knows how to use.
&gt;
&gt;If you know a programming language such as C++ or Java, go ahead and list those; advanced statistical and financial analysis programs are also fine to list.
&gt;
&gt;Just as with â€œFluency in English,â€ I assume you are â€œfluentâ€ in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So donâ€™t re-assure me.

&gt;While most employers definitely want to know you as a person and the things you enjoy in your off time, pull off all of those ""special skills"" that everyone has and just aren't important for your job. Things like ""Microsoft Office (all ver.)"" or ""Windows and Mac Operating Systems"" are not only implied for any job that requires use of a computer, they take up space you could use to make a real impactâ€”or better yet, keep your resume trim and to the point.

That's a lie. He matched an initial description and that's fair. Ometu is right to be upset because he doesn't know what's going and probably doesn't want any involvement.

Transportation is just the tip of the iceberg though. Transit fails for any number of reasons, but the top may as weâ€™ll be that our preferred urban development patterns canâ€™t support it.

Go for it, get your 100k signatures and maybe she will actually get the dye job done; politicians wear those stupid lapel pins because of ""popular opinion"" maybe your movement will have a similar effect.

Treâ€¦ lost major points in my book when all their pasta has started coming out salty. Took my mom and dad there for a lunch treat during restaurant weeks and ordered the wine pairing. It was a glass of wine with each of the three courses. When the waiter failed to bring out one of the glasses of wine, and we asked for it, he told me that there were only wine pairings for two of the three courses. We asked for the menus and he said it was clearly stated there were only two and walked away. Never saw the menus. Had to google their lunch time restaurant weeks menu and show himâ€¦ which then prompted him to bring us that wine. Mind you- still got charged.

Haha none of this gives any reason why the business owner is racist. Calling people racist with absolutely zero evidence makes you an asshole.

Racist should be a serious term, not something you throw out as a buzzword. You're devaluing this word and hurting the actual victims of racism in the world.

Your arguments hold no weight whatsoever. Honestly, I hope you're trolling because I didn't think people who claim everything is racist like you do actually existed. Your argument can be boiled down to, Trump and all of his supporters are racist because I say so, and if you disagree you're just a basement dweller at your moms house, correct?

He first said the phrase ""the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings"" on a 1978 newscast discussing the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets. The phrase was then attributed to Bullets coach Dick Motta, who had borrowed it during Washington's successful 1978 title run.[7]

"Reason I like Waze:  
  
- Road Closures (Not all of them, but more than GMaps, as GMaps gets its closure info from Waze)
- Updates are volunteer managed
  - More accurate maps given lots of changing highways due to construction
  - Additions like Parking Lot Roads or New neighborhoods can be live in the app in as little as 18 hours. 
- Similar or Faster routes than GMaps
- Hazard &amp; Police Reports  
  
As a delivery driver, I am ALL OVER the city (Though, admittedly, south of 90 doesnt order much from amazon). And I've use Waze and Google maps, even tried apple maps (for about 5 minutes) and various other paid navigation apps... The only reasonable options are Google Maps and Waze, but I still prefer Waze over Google Maps.  
  
Also, Waze only gets better the more people use it. Even more accurate traffic data (Though its very good as it is), and faster updates for road closures and reopenings, accidents, etc.  
  
Also, I LOVE when people give me delivery notes ""My address isnt in GPS so turn here, exit here, go X etc...."" I just put the address in Waze and 90% of the time at very least the road has been mapped, if not the individual house number too.

"The fuck you on about ? The reason the electric Bills being so high was due to Texas being capitalist shills. In sum, the sky-high electric bills in Texas are partly due to a deregulated electricity system that allowed volatile wholesale costs to be passed directly to some consumers. If prices in the Texas retail market had remained regulated, utilities and their regulators would likely have figured out some way to spread those high electric costs out over time instead of hitting customers all at once. But the state public utility commission also contributed by setting the ERCOT price at $9,000 per megawatt-hour and keeping it there for a week, ensuring that bills for some Texans would skyrocket.

Hand outs ? Itâ€™s not a handout when youâ€™re being exploited by bullshit profit driven companies that looked at our situation and immediately realized how much profit they could make off people in desperate situations.

I may jumped the gun on what I was replying too but  if you think that ERCOTT isnâ€™t recouping from this in different ways, spreading the cost out over the next years, youâ€™re mistaken. 

My point still stands. So not only are people behind because of covid and loss of jobs, due to no fault of their own. Theyâ€™ll be paying increased electrical price overall.

From what I *can* see, it looks to me that testing has increased substantially by about 10,000 with about 50% more negative or inconclusive tests and 40% fewer positive tests between the peaks shown from the available dates in July to Nov 15.  
  
Wouldn't that suggest exactly what I was saying, that the increases we are seeing lately are largely due to increased testing, not increased infections?  
  
I understand that we're having increases over the relative dip we've had throughout the past couple of months, but it doesn't look to be on the same level as what we saw in July and August. So again, it seems like my question was on point.",,,N,N
I was choosing cyber security because itâ€™s growing and because I was an aircraft mechanic in the military and enjoyed fixing and maintaining equipment and doing data base management with equipment control before I left. Figured those skills could transfer well into cyber security. Was a computer science major but couldnâ€™t handle the STEM math classes which is why I switched to cyber security. Hopefully I made a good choice switching. ,,,N,Y

&gt; Total number of people convicted of trafficking minors
&gt; These charts show the total number of people convicted of trafficking minors in Texas that served prison time between 2012 and the present. The first chart shows numbers for the five counties with the most convictions overall. The second chart shows the same numbers for the five counties with the most convictions per capita.
&gt;   
&gt; *Per capita numbers were calculated using only counties with 100,000+ residents and at least four convictions.
&gt; Note: Totals may be underreported if cases of child trafficking were tried more generally as human trafficking

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams â€” while pimping Amber and Cooper â€” was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber â€” the name she used while she was being trafficked â€” asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",,,N,N

"Hi, as I mentioned earlier, the evidence is clear that COVID is a threat to the country. It is not however clear that a curfew will move the needle. There are no studies or recommendations from prominent/reputable US scientists or communities backing this up. If Covid laws and orders continue to pop-up without a clear scientific basis, then that will ultimately undermine all measures. This order to me feels like it was made for political reasons behind closed doors. There is no legislation that has been proposed; this is just a dictated order. All the lawmakers (besides the mayor/judge) that would support this kind of measure should have their names on paper. 

What constitutes an emergency? Where I live, things look fine in my large neighborhood, outside of city limits. My Facebook feed is not blowing up with friends that are hospitalized. My immediate and extended family are fine. I know one person personally that has died from Covid, and he lived on the southside, far away from me. I donâ€™t know anyone else personally that has been hospitalized.  I know two other people in Bexar county that were infected way back in the summer.  
Houses are not on fire and there are not riots in the streets. Thanksgiving NFL games were playing on the TV, including Dallas.  People were peacefully Black Friday shopping.  Instagram was full of nice Thanksgiving posts.  Life looks almost normal to me â€” besides the masks, a smaller thanksgiving gathering, and the hope for a vaccine soon.  A county-wide â€œEmergencyâ€ is a stretch.  This exec order is not a targeted approach, and it was done at the last possible minute.

Regarding my point that this would cause people to go out of their way to defy the order, Iâ€™m not strawman-ing if itâ€™s true, right?  Iâ€™m not basing my entire  argument on this point, Iâ€™m just stating that this is a foreseeable consequence of a hasty order.  There were in fact hundreds of protesters in front of the Alamo last night; and most of these people probably live outside city limits, and then they come down to the heart of city, not wearing masks.  And thatâ€™s just the people that had the balls to be seen downtown; we know there are way more that got together and barbecued on their front porch, waiting for someone to tell them something. This is Texas, not California or New York.  The majority of the culture will not stand for an exec order like this, and there will be no hope of turning this state purple if we keep poking conservatives like this.  Masks are fine, curfews are not.  (Iâ€™m actually okay with a red Texas for now, though.)

The exec order and the subsequent Q&amp;A specifically said that the order applied to inside private homes. The government staying out of our households, our bodies, and our digital lives is fundamental. Many many people with different backgrounds will naturally see this as an invasive affront; and to tell them that they are babies and whiners will win no one over. (Of course if the police have reason to believe that someone is being abused in a house, then they have every right to investigate.)   I pick my battles; mandatory seatbelts were the law nationally before I was born, so I will not expend energy on arguing to reverse that.  Covid curfews is something new, and I feel I have an opportunity to influence those that are on the fence about them.

You didnâ€™t accuse me of this, but Iâ€™d still like to say that Iâ€™m not a Trumpist, nor am I Republican. I didnâ€™t vote for Biden this time, but depending on his approach to civil liberties and the free market economy during his term, I could change my mind.",,,Y,N

"&gt; People love to blame our politicians for not giving us the proper restrictions, but I and most reasonably responsible people I know, including basically my entire family, have self-quarantined, worn masks in public, and kept up with social distancing since before anyone was really ordering restrictions.

Congratulations. Now remember that 1/6 San Antonians (25yo or older) dropped out of high school. Only 1/3 ever finished college. We're [pretty close to the bottom](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2014/02/san-antonio-ranks-near-the-bottom-in-national.html) of educational attainment.

So you figure some dude with only a high school diploma is wondering what to do in a pandemic. He can google random shit and maybe he'll find a trustworthy site; maybe not. Did he ever learn how to do that?

The President isn't wearing a mask. Neither is the Vice President. What's he supposed to do? Copy the most powerful people in the country I suppose.

Like it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy. Or maybe they just listen to the President because ""he has all the info he needs.""

The absolute *most important* job the President has is to set the tone of the country. There's a reason this country went to fucking shit and everyone is miserable under Trump and it's because he set a terrible tone that has destroyed people's psyches.",,,Y,N
